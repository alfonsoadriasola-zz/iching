### The Judgement
> Conflict. You are sincere  
> 
 And are being obstructed.  
> 
 A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.  
> 
 Going through to the end brings misfortune.  
> 
 It furthers one to see the great man.  
> 
 It does not further one to cross the great water.
### The Image
> Heaven and water go their opposite ways:  
> 
 The image of Conflict.  
> 
 Thus in all his transactions the superior man  
> 
 Carefully considers the beginning.
