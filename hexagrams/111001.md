### The Judgement
> Innocence. Supreme success.  
 Perseverance furthers.  
 If someone is not as he should be,  
 He has misfortune,  
 And it does not further him  
 To undertake something.
### The Image
> Under heaven thunder rolls:  
 All things attain the natural state of innocence.  
 Thus the kings of old,  
 Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,  
 Fostered and nourished all beings.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Innocent behavior brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 If one does not count on the harvest while plowing,  
 Nor on the use of the ground while clearing it,  
 It furthers one to undertake something.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Undeserved misfortune.  
 The cow that was tethered by someone  
 Is the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 He who can be persevering  
 Remains without blame.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Use no medicine in an illness  
 Incurred through no fault of your own.  
 It will pass of itself.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Innocent action brings misfortune.  
 Nothing furthers.
