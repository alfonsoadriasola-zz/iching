<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
The Well. The town may be changed,<br>
But the well cannot be changed.<br>
It neither decreases nor increases.<br>
They come and go and draw from the well.<br>
If one gets down almost to the water<br>
And the rope does not go all the way,<br>
Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Water over wood: the image of The Well.<br>
Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,<br>
And exhorts them to help one another.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
One does not drink the mud of the well.<br>
No animals come to an old well.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
At the well hole one shoots fishes.<br>
The jug is broken and leaks.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it.<br>
This is my heart's sorrow,<br>
For one might draw from it.<br>
If the king were clear-minded,<br>
Good fortune might be enjoyed in common.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
The well is being lined. No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
In the well there is a clear, cold spring<br>
From which one can drink.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
One draws from the well<br>
Without hindrance.<br>
It is dependable.<br>
Supreme good fortune.<br>
