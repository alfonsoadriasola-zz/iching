### The Judgement
> Influence. Success.  
 Perseverance furthers.  
 To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.
### The Image
> A lake on the mountain:  
 The image of Influence.  
 Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him  
 By his readiness to receive them.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 The influence shows itself in the big toe.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 The influence shows itself in the calves of the legs.  
 Misfortune.  
 Tarrying brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 The influence shows itself in the thighs.  
 Holds to that which follows it.  
 To continue is humiliating.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 Remorse disappears.  
 If a man is agitated in mind,  
 And his thoughts go hither and thither,  
 Only those friends  
 On whom he fixes his conscious thoughts  
 Will follow.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 The influence shows itself in the back of the neck.  
 No remorse.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 The influence shows itself in the jaws, cheeks and tongue.
