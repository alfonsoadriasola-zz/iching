<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
The Marrying Maiden.<br>
Undertakings bring misfortune.<br>
Nothing that would further.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Thunder over the lake:<br>
The image of The Marrying Maiden.<br>
Thus the superior man<br>
Understands the transitory<br>
In the light of the eternity of the end.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
The marrying maiden as a concubine.<br>
A lame man who is able to tread.<br>
Undertakings bring good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
A one-eyed man who is able to see.<br>
The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
The marrying maiden as a slave.<br>
She marries as a concubine.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
The marrying maiden draws out the allotted time.<br>
A late marriage comes in due course.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage.<br>
The embroidered garments of the princess<br>
Were not as gorgeous<br>
As those of the servingmaid.<br>
The moon that is nearly full<br>
Brings good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it.<br>
The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows.<br>
Nothing that acts to further.<br>
