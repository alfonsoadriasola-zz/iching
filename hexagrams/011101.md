 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Wrapped in the hide of a yellow cow.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 When one's own day comes, one may create revolution.  
 Starting brings good fortune. No blame.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Starting brings misfortune.  
 Perseverance brings danger.  
 When the talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times,  
 One may commit himself,  
 And men will believe him.

 Remorse disappears. Men believe him.  
 Changing the form of government brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 The great man changes like a tiger.  
 Even before he questions the oracle  
 He is believed.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 The superior man changes like a panther.  
 The inferior man molts in the face.  
 Starting brings misfortune.  
 To remain persevering brings good fortune.  
 And makes the seasons clear.
