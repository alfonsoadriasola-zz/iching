### The Judgement
> Increase. It furthers one  
 To undertake something.  
 It furthers one to cross the great water.
### The Image
> Wind and thunder: the image of Increase.  
 Thus the superior man:  
 If he sees good, he imitates it;  
 If he has faults, he rids himself of them.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 It furthers one to accomplish great deeds.  
 Supreme good fortune. No blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Someone does indeed increase him;  
 Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.  
 Constant perseverance brings good fortune.  
 The king presents him before God.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 One is enriched through unfortunate events.  
 No blame, if you are sincere  
 And walk in the middle,  
 And report with a seal to the prince.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 If you walk in the middle  
 And report to the prince,  
 He will follow.  
 It furthers one to be used  
 In the removal of the capital.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not.  
 Supreme good fortune.  
 Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 He brings increase to no one.  
 Indeed, someone even strikes him.  
 He does not keep his heart constantly steady.  
 Misfortune.
