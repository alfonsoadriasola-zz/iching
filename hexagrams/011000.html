<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Gathering Together. Success.<br>
The king approaches his temple.<br>
It furthers one to see the great man.<br>
This brings success. Perseverance furthers.<br>
To bring great offerings creates good fortune.<br>
It furthers one to undertake something.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Over the earth, the lake:<br>
The image of Gathering Together.<br>
Thus the superior man renews his weapons<br>
In order to meet the unforseen.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
If you are sincere, but not to the end,<br>
There will sometimes be confusion, sometimes gathering together.<br>
If you call out,<br>
Then after one grasp of the hand you can laugh again.<br>
Regret not. Going is without blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Letting oneself be drawn<br>
Brings good fortune and remains blameless.<br>
If one is sincere,<br>
It furthers one to bring even a small offering.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Gathering together amid sighs.<br>
Nothing that would not further.<br>
Going is without blame.<br>
Slight humiliation.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
Great good fortune. No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
If in gathering together one has position,<br>
This brings no blame.<br>
If there are some who are not yet sincere in the work,<br>
Sublime and enduring perseverance is needed.<br>
Then remorse disappears.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears.<br>
No blame.<br>
