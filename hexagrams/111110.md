### The Judgement
> Coming to Meet. The maiden is powerful.  
 One should not marry such a maiden.
### The Image
> Under heaven, wind:  
 The image of Coming to Meet.  
 Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands  
 And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 It must be checked with a brake of bronze.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.  
 Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 There is a fish in the tank. No blame.  
 Does not further guests.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 There is no skin on his thighs,  
 And walking comes hard.  
 If one is mindful of the danger,  
 No great mistake is made.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 No fish in the tank.  
 This leads to misfortune.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 A melon covered with willow leaves.  
 Hidden lines.  
 Then it drops down to one from heaven.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 He comes to meet with his horns.  
 Humiliation. No blame.
