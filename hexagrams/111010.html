<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Conflict. You are sincere<br>
And are being obstructed.<br>
A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.<br>
Going through to the end brings misfortune.<br>
It furthers one to see the great man.<br>
It does not further one to cross the great water.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Heaven and water go their opposite ways:<br>
The image of Conflict.<br>
Thus in all his transactions the superior man<br>
Carefully considers the beginning.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
If one does not perpetuate the affair,<br>
There is little gossip.<br>
In the end, good fortune comes.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
One cannot engage in conflict;<br>
One returns home, gives way.<br>
The people of his town,<br>
Three hundred households,<br>
Remain free of guilt.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.<br>
Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.<br>
If by chance you are in the service of a king,<br>
Seek not works.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
One cannot engage in conflict.<br>
One turns back and submits to fate,<br>
Changes one's attitude,<br>
And finds peace in perseverance.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
To contend before him<br>
Brings good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one,<br>
By the end of morning<br>
It will have been snatched away three times.<br>
