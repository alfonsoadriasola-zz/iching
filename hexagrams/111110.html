<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Coming to Meet. The maiden is powerful.<br>
One should not marry such a maiden.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Under heaven, wind:<br>
The image of Coming to Meet.<br>
Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands<br>
And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
It must be checked with a brake of bronze.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.<br>
Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
There is a fish in the tank. No blame.<br>
Does not further guests.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
There is no skin on his thighs,<br>
And walking comes hard.<br>
If one is mindful of the danger,<br>
No great mistake is made.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
No fish in the tank.<br>
This leads to misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
A melon covered with willow leaves.<br>
Hidden lines.<br>
Then it drops down to one from heaven.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
He comes to meet with his horns.<br>
Humiliation. No blame.<br>
</blockquote>
