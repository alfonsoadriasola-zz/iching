<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Dispersion. Success.<br>
The king approaches his temple.<br>
It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
Perseverance furthers.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
The wind drives over the water:<br>
The image of Dispersion.<br>
Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord<br>
And built temples.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
He brings help with the strength of a horse.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
At the dissolution<br>
He hurries to that which supports him.<br>
Remorse disappears.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
He dissolves his self. No remorse.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
He dissolves his bond with his group.<br>
Supreme good fortune.<br>
Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation.<br>
This is something that ordinary men do not think of.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat.<br>
Dissolution! A king abides without blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
He dissolves his blood.<br>
Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,<br>
Is without blame.<br>
