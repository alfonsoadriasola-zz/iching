### The Judgement
> The Power of the Great. Perseverance furthers.
### The Image
> Thunder in heaven above:  
 The image of The Power of the Great.  
 Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths  
 That do not accord with established order.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Power in the toes.  
 Continuing brings misfortune.  
 This is certainly true.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 The inferior man works through power.  
 The superior man does not act thus.  
 To continue is dangerous.  
 A goat butts against a hedge  
 And gets its horns entangled.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 Remorse disappears.  
 The hedge opens; there is no entanglement.  
 Power depends upon the axle of a big cart.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Loses the goat with ease.  
 No remorse.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 A goat butts against a hedge.  
 It cannot go backward, it cannot go forward.  
 Nothing serves to further.  
 If one notes the difficulty, this brings good fortune.
