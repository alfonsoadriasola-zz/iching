### The Judgement
> The Wanderer. Success through smallness.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune  
 To the wanderer.
### The Image
> Fire on the mountain:  
 The image of The Wanderer.  
 Thus the superior man  
 Is clear-minded and cautious  
 In imposing penalties,  
 And protracts no lawsuits.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 If the wanderer busies himself with trivial things,  
 He draws down misfortune upon himself.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 The wanderer comes to and inn.  
 He has his property with him.  
 He wins the steadfastness of a young servant.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 The wanderer's inn burns down.  
 He loses the steadfastness of his young servant.  
 Danger.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The wanderer rests in a shelter.  
 He obtains his property and an ax.  
 My heart is not glad.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 He shoots a pheasant.  
 It drops with the first arrow.  
 In the end this brings both praise and office.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 The bird's nest burns up.  
 The wanderer laughs at first,  
 Then must needs lament and weep.  
 Through carelessness he loses his cow.  
 Misfortune.
