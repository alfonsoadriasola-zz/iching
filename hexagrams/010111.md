### The Judgement
> Waiting. If you are sincere,  
 You have light and success.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 It furthers one to cross the great water.
### The Image
> Clouds rise up to heaven:  
 The image of Waiting.  
 Thus the superior man eats and drinks,  
 Is joyous and of good cheer.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 Waiting in the meadow.  
 It furthers one to abide in what endures.  
 No blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Waiting on the sand.  
 There is some gossip.  
 The end brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 Waiting in the mud  
 Brings about the arrival of the enemy.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Waiting in blood.  
 Get out of the pit.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Waiting at meat and drink.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 One falls into the pit.  
 Three uninvited guests arrive.  
 Honor them, and in the end there will be good fortune.
