### The Judgement
> Youthful Folly has success.  
> 
 It is not I who seek the young fool;  
> 
 The young fool seeks me.  
> 
 At the first oracle I inform him.  
> 
 If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.  
> 
 If he importunes, I give him no information.  
> 
 Perseverance furthers.
### The Image
> A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:  
> 
 The image of Youth.  
> 
 Thus the superior man fosters his character  
> 
 By thoroughness in all that he does.
