### The Judgement
> Retreat. Success.  
 In what is small, perseverance furthers.
### The Image
> Mountain under heaven: the image of Retreat.  
 Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,  
 Not angrily but with reserve.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 At the tail in retreat. This is dangerous.  
 One must not wish to undertake anything.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 He holds him fast with yellow oxhide.  
 No one can tear him loose.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 A halted retreat  
 Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.  
 To retain people as men- and maidservants  
 Brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man  
 And downfall to the inferior man.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Friendly retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 Cheerful retreat. Everything serves to further.
