      ```---------```

### The Judgement
> Before Completion. Success.  
 But if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing,  
 Gets his tail in the water,  
 There is nothing that would further.
### The Image
> Fire over water:  
 The image of the condition before transition.  
 Thus the superior man is careful  
 In the differentiation of things,  
 So that each finds its place.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 He gets his tail in the water.  
 Humiliating.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 He brakes his wheels.  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 Before completion, attack brings misfortune.  
 It furthers one to cross the great water.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 Remorse disappears.  
 Shock, thus to discipline the Devil's Country.  
 For three years, great realms are awarded.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 Perseverance brings good fortune.  
 No remorse.  
 The light of the superior man is true.  
 Good fortune.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 There is drinking of wine  
 In genuine confidence. No blame.  
 But if one wets his head,  
 He loses it, in truth.
