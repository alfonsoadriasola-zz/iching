<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Abundance has success.<br>
The king attains abundance.<br>
Be not sad.<br>
Be like the sun at midday.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Both thunder and lightning come:<br>
The image of Abundance.<br>
Thus the superior man decides lawsuits<br>
And carries out punishments.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
When a man meets his destined ruler,<br>
They can be together ten days,<br>
And it is not a mistake.<br>
Going meets with recognition.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
The curtain is of such fullness<br>
That the polestars can be seen at noon.<br>
Through going one meets with mistrust and hate.<br>
If one rouses him through truth,<br>
Good fortune comes.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
The underbrush is of such abundance<br>
That the small stars can be seen at noon.<br>
He breaks his right arm. No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
The curtain is of such fullness<br>
That the polestars can be seen at noon.<br>
He meets his ruler, who is of like kind.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Lines are coming,<br>
Blessing and fame draw near.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
His house is in a state of abundance.<br>
He screens off his family.<br>
He peers through the gate<br>
And no longer perceives anyone.<br>
For three years he sees nothing.<br>
Misfortune.<br>
