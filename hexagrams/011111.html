<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Break-through. One must resolutely make the matter known<br>
At the court of the king.<br>
It must be announced truthfully. Danger.<br>
It is necessary to notify one's own city.<br>
It does not further to resort to arms.<br>
It furthers one to undertake something.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
The lake has risen up to heaven:<br>
The image of Break-through.<br>
Thus the superior man<br>
Dispenses riches downward<br>
And refrains from resting on his virtue.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
Mighty in the forward-striding toes.<br>
When one goes and is not equal to the task,<br>
One makes a mistake.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
A cry of alarm. Arms at evening and at night.<br>
Fear nothing.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
To be powerful in the cheekbones<br>
Brings misfortune.<br>
The superior man is firmly resolved.<br>
He walks alone and is caught in the rain.<br>
He is bespattered,<br>
And people murmur against him.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
There is no skin on his thighs,<br>
And walking comes hard.<br>
If a man were to let himself be led like a sheep,<br>
Remorse would disappear.<br>
But if these words are heard<br>
They will not be believed.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
In dealing with weeds,<br>
Firm resolution is necessary.<br>
Walking in the middle<br>
Remains free of blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
No cry.<br>
In the end misfortune comes.<br>
