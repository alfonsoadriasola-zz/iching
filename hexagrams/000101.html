<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Darkening of the Light. In adversity<br>
It furthers one to be persevering.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
The light has sunk into the earth:<br>
The image of Darkening of the Light.<br>
Thus does the superior man live with the great mass:<br>
He veils his light, yet still shines.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
Darkening of the light during flight.<br>
He lowers his wings.<br>
The superior man does not eat for three days<br>
On his wanderings.<br>
But he has somewhere to go.<br>
The host has occasion to gossip about him.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Darkening of the light injures him in the left thigh.<br>
He gives aid with the strength of a horse.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south.<br>
Their great leader is captured.<br>
One must not expect perseverance too soon.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
He penetrates the left side of the belly.<br>
One gets at the very heart of the darkening of the light,<br>
And leaves gate and courtyard.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Darkening of the light as with Prince Chi.<br>
Perseverance furthers.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
Not light but darkness.<br>
First he climbed up to heaven,<br>
Then he plunged into the depths of the earth.<br>
