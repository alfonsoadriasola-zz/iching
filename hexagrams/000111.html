<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Peace. The small departs,<br>
The great approaches.<br>
Good fortune. Success.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Heaven and earth unite: the image of Peace.<br>
Thus the ruler<br>
Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth;<br>
He furthers and regulates the gifts of heaven and earth,<br>
And so aids the people.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.<br>
Each according to his kind.<br>
Undertakings bring good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness,<br>
Fording the river with resolution,<br>
Not neglecting what is distant,<br>
Not regarding one's companions:<br>
Thus one may manage to walk in the middle.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
No plain not followed by a slope.<br>
No going not followed by a return.<br>
He who remains persevering in danger<br>
Is without blame.<br>
Do not complain about this truth;<br>
Enjoy the good fortune you still possess.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
He flutters down, not boasting of his wealth,<br>
Together with his neighbor,<br>
Guileless and sincere.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
The sovereign I<br>
Gives his daughter in marriage.<br>
This brings blessing<br>
And supreme good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
The wall falls back into the moat.<br>
Use no army now.<br>
Make your commands known within your own town.<br>
Perseverance brings humiliation.<br>
