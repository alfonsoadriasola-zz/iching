### The Judgement
> Preponderance of the Great.  
 The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.  
 It furthers one to have somewhere to go.  
 Success.
### The Image
> The lake rises above the trees:  
 The image of Preponderance of the Great.  
 Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,  
 Is unconcerned,  
 And if he has to renounce the world,  
 He is undaunted.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 To spread white rushes underneath.  
 No blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 A dry poplar sprouts at the root.  
 An older man takes a young wife.  
 Everything furthers.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.  
 Misfortune.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune.  
 If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 A withered poplar puts forth flowers.  
 An older woman takes a husband.  
 No blame. No praise.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 One must go through the water.  
 It goes over one's head.  
 Misfortune. No blame.
