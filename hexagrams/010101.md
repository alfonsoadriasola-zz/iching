### The Judgement
> After Completion. Success in small matters.  
 Perseverance furthers.  
 At the beginning good fortune,  
 At the end disorder.
### The Image
> Water over fire: the image of the condition  
 In After Completion.  
 Thus the superior man  
 Takes thoughts of misfortune  
 And arms himself against it in advance.
### The Lines

 > **Change at the beginning means:**  
 He brakes his wheels.  
 He gets his tail in the water.  
 No blame.
 > **Change in the second place means:**  
 The woman loses the curtain of her carriage.  
 Do not run after it;  
 On the seventh day you will get it.
 > **Change in the third place means:**  
 The Illustrious Ancestor  
 Disciplines the Devil's Country.  
 After three years he conquers it.  
 Inferior people must not be employed.
 > **Change in the fourth place means:**  
 The finest clothes turn to rags.  
 Be careful all day long.
 > **Change in the fifth place means:**  
 The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox  
 Does not attain as much real happiness  
 As the neighbor in the west  
 With his small offering.
 > **Change at the top means:**  
 He gets his head in the water. Danger.
